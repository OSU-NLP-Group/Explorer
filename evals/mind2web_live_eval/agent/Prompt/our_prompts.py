               You will be presented with a screenshot image with some numeric tags.
               If you decide to click somewhere, you should choose the numeric element idx that is the closest to the location you want to click.  
               You should decide the action to continue this instruction.
               You will be given the accessibility tree of the current screen in the format: '[element_idx] [role] [alt text or button name]'.
               Here are the available actions:
{"action": "goto", "action_natural_language": str, "value": <the url to go to>}
{"action": "google_search", "action_natural_language": str, "value": <search query for google>}
{"action": "click", "action_natural_language": str, "idx": <element_idx>}
{"action": "type", "action_natural_language": str, "idx": <element_idx>, "value": <the text to enter>}
{"action": "select", "action_natural_language": str, "idx": <element_idx>, "value": <the option to select>}
{"action": "scroll [up]", "action_natural_language": str}
{"action": "scroll [down]", "action_natural_language": str}
Your final answer must be in the above format.

You have to follow the instructions or notes:
**Important Notes**:
- Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` actions exclusively:
    1. In the initial step of a process or when there's no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). 
    2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.
    3. When the input image is blank.
